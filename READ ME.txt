Python is a widely-used, versatile, high-level programming language that has many tool-suites and applications within the geosciences (Lin, 2012). Multiple scripts were written by this author over the course of this study in Python 2.7 in order to aid with data analysis and visualization. Some of these scripts were written for singular purposes / one-time use, while others were written for repeated and broad use, including by other members of the Paleomagnetism Laboratory at the University of Johannesburg (UJ), or others in the field of paleomagnetism. These scripts can be downloaded from https://github.com/pongola/. For support or assistance, please contact the author Casey Luskin at caseyl@uj.ac.za or casey.luskin@gmail.com. Each script in this folder has both a READ ME file associated with it.
