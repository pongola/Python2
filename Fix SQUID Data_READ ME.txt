Name: Fix SQUID Data

Filename: Fix-SQUID-Data.crl.python2_v2.py

Author: Casey Luskin

Summary: This text-based Python script fixes RAPID SQUID data that was measured with a “Z” parameter incorrectly outputted with an inverse sign on the 2G SQUID magnetometer at UJ. This led to a wrong sign on the inclination in core coordinates, which led to geographic and tilt-corrected coordinates also being incorrect. 

Intended Scope of use: This script was used in this study and by others in the UJ paleomag lab to correct incorrectly outputted data. 

Requirements: Python 2.7 installed on Windows or Mac with standard built-in Python libraries/modules. 

Input: Site name and data in RAPID SQUID format. 

Output: RAPID SQUID data correctly rotated with z parameter in core coordinates corrected. 

Number of lines of code: 363

Other Credits: Some segments of filereading code adapted from a script written by Michiel de Kock. Script was also based upon an Excel spreadsheet created by Michiel de Kock with proper formulas, “Core to strat coordinates_fixed.xlsx.” For the complete mathematics on spherical coordinate transformations, see Cox and Hart (1986), pp. 226-228.
